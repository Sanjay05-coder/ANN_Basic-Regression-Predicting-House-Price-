# üè† House Price Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (Regression)

This project demonstrates a **House Price Prediction** model using **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** for a **regression task**. The dataset used is **synthetic**, generated to simulate realistic housing features such as the number of rooms, area size, and other relevant parameters. The model predicts continuous house prices based on these numerical input features.

## üß† Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build, train, and evaluate an ANN capable of predicting house prices accurately. The network is implemented using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, with data preprocessing and evaluation handled by **NumPy**  The project follows a standard supervised learning workflow, including data generation, scaling, model training, and performance evaluation.
